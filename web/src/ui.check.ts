/** The renderer's own rules, checked without a browser.
 *
 *  Run: node --experimental-strip-types src/ui.check.ts   (from web/)
 *
 *  Three properties, and each one is a bug this branch actually shipped:
 *
 *  1. PORTABILITY. Nothing in web/src may type a station, a flag, a
 *     capability, a bundle id or a declared view's title. The same renderer
 *     draws a health centre's line and a laboratory's bench, and the only
 *     reason that keeps working is that a word on screen comes from a
 *     declaration or does not appear. This is checked against the COMPILED
 *     vocabulary, so it grows automatically when a bundle does -- the
 *     previous spelling was a hand-kept list of one bundle's words.
 *
 *  2. THE MENUS ARE NOT LISTS. `/` is thread.actions, already narrowed by the
 *     guard, and `@` is the declared roles. A literal menu would look right
 *     on the demo and offer refused actions on anything else.
 *
 *  3. ACCESSIBILITY (§68). An icon-only control with no accessible name, a
 *     positive tabIndex, or an animation that ignores prefers-reduced-motion.
 *
 *  THE HONEST LIMIT. This reads .tsx and .css as text under plain node: no
 *  DOM, no cascade, no layout. It cannot prove a contrast ratio that only
 *  exists once the cascade runs, it cannot see a rectangle, and it cannot tell
 *  a handler that runs from one that is attached and inert. Those need the
 *  browser, and the browser is where the flex-shrink bug that clipped every
 *  card was actually found -- not here.
